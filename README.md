# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

**Description**

This is a project for Practicum's students to put in practice everything they have learned so far about HTML, CSS and responsive design.

In it, the elements will be structured used flexbox and grid to ensure the correct visualization of the page across all possible widths.

**Technologies used**

To develop this web page it has been used:

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The main language to build the core blocks of the web page.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets. Necessary to describe the presentation of the HTML document.
- Flexbox: CSS Web Layout model that allows for the elements in a web page to become responsive.
- Grid: Another CSS layout model that works in a similar way as flexbox. It's stronger than flexbox on complex blocks like tables.
