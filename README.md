# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This is a project for Practicum's students to put in practice everything they have learned so far about HTML, CSS and responsive design.

In it, the elements will be structured used flexbox and grid to ensure the correct visualization of the page across all possible widths.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
