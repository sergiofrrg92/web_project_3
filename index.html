                  Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                  the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their
                  right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here,
                  in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers
                  are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the
                  spring are are absolutely amazing.

                <p class="place__description">
                  The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and
                  soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified
                  balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the
                  landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and
                  those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
                  interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on
                  the far outskirts of the right one.

                  The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                  from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                  been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                  years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                  Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                  summer months.

                  A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                  world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret
                  ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                  claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom
                  award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral
                  displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George,
                  the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of
                  the UK.

                  Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky.
                  The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside.
                  It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                  visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops
                  with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass
                  studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival
                  celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and
                  served with a wooden spoon.

                  However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                  College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                  south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                  coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition —
                  every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                  Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom
                  era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of
                  its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO
                  World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of

                  The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you
                  would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above
                  sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                  province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                  plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up
                  the bulk of Burundi's exports.

                  The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves

                  the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of
                  altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source

                  Madrid (/məˈdrɪd/ mə-DRID, Spanish: [maˈðɾið])[n. 1] is the
                  capital and most populous city of Spain. The city has almost
                  3.4 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of
                  approximately 6.7 million. It is the second-largest city in
                  the European Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin in its
                  administrative limits, and its monocentric metropolitan area
                  is the second-largest in the EU, surpassed only by Paris. The
                  municipality covers 604.3 km2 (233.3 sq mi) geographical area.

                  The Madrid urban agglomeration has the second-largest GDP in
                  the European Union and its influence in politics, education,
                  entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture,
                  and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the
                  world's major global cities. Due to its economic output, high
                  standard of living, and market size, Madrid is considered the
                  major financial centre[18] and the leading economic hub of the
                  Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe. The metropolitan
                  area hosts major Spanish companies such as Telefónica, Iberia,
                  BBVA and FCC. It concentrates the bulk of banking operations
                  in the country and it is the Spanish-speaking city generating
                  the largest amount of webpages.
